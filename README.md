A magic mod about harnessing magic as a science, while you uncover the enlightening ruins and vaults of a dead magitech civilization and discover the (unfortunately still living) extrauniversal thing that killed them.
Unique spell system and expansive progression tree with hints of sci-fi, and potential future plans for planetary exploration. Generally an all-purpose mod designed around having room for any kind of content we want to explore while staying coherent and 'legit'. Our main project.
